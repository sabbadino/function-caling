Title: Azure Open ai copilots
Where: microsoft build 2023

As far as copilots, the other maine theme of the dev conference, Microsoft announced:

Copilot in Power BI
Copilot in Power Pages in preview
Copilot in Microsoft Fabric, available in preview soon (for more on Fabric, see "Build 2023: Meet Fabric, the AI-fication of Microsoft's Data Business")
Windows Copilot, which will start to become available for preview next month
In introducing Windows Copilot, the company said it makes Windows 11 the first PC platform to announce centralized AI assistance for helping users take actions and get things done.

Windows Copilot is deemed so important by Microsoft that CEO Satya Nadella himself announced in a LinkedIn post that it was among more than 50 updates for developers being unveiled at the conference. Other updates he mentioned were bringing Bing to ChatGPT and a new Copilot Stack with common extensibility.

The latter is described as an AI development framework that helps developers build their own copilots. "This stack includes support for plugins that augment the capabilities of AI systems by allowing them to retrieve real-time information, incorporate company or other business data, perform new types of computations and safely take action on the user's behalf," Microsoft explained.

Copilot Stack was introduced early in the conference by Microsoft's cloud/AI chief, Scott Guthrie, who described them as "the actuators of the digital world."

The new extensibility model was also discussed by Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott, who said copilot development starts with an idea, like any software project, with the difference being the realm of possibilities that the AI development platform enables.
