Title: Microsoft Build 2023: Copilots & Plugins
Where: microsoft build 2023

At this week's kickoff of the big Microsoft AI 2023 developer conference -- oops, sorry, that's "Microsoft Build 2023" developer conference -- it was all copilots and plugins.

Yes, AI took center stage -- and front stage and back stage and all the stages in between.

Why?

Because "You only need two simple letters to accurately convey the major shift in the technology space this year: A and I," according to Frank X. Shaw, Microsoft's chief communications officer, who penned a blog post on Tuesday, May 23, the start of the three-day online/in-person event.

Two major themes permeating the conference are copilots -- AI assistants across a broad swath of products and services -- and plugins, which effectively transform copilots into aggregators, potentially making them one-stop shops for both enterprise and consumer customers.
