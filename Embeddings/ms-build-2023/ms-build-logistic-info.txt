Similar to other developer conferences like Google I/O and Apple’s WWDC, Microsoft uses Build to make feature announcements for its platforms and provide in-depth sessions for developers and other professionals that rely on its tools. Although there’s been the odd hardware announcement at past Build conferences, Microsoft is normally pretty focused on software and services.

This year’s Build is heavily focusing on AI, with new additions of the CoPilot experience to Windows 11 and Edge, as well as new Bing AI and Copilot plugins for OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Microsoft has been busy in recent months building generative AI into many of its products and services, including search engine Bing, browser Edge, GitHub, and Office productivity suite, and it’s showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon.
