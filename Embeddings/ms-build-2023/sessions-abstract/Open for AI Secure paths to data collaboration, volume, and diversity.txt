session title: Open for AI: Secure paths to data collaboration, volume, and diversity
abstract: Sharing data has never been under such risk of attack, making collaborating on global-scale initiatives challenging. So how can applications for all ranges of use cases work to improve our communities? Leveraging Intelâ€™s vast engineering resources, we are working to open up platforms in all regions of the world. From our physical hardware security solutions like SGX, Gramine, or TDX to our open-source work with AI tools, Intel is deeply integrated to support open and standardized AI solutions.
