session title: State of the Art Data Retrieval with Machine Learning & Elasticsearch
abstract: Join our deep dive to discuss how to use Elasticsearch for data retrieval with Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service. We’ll cover how context from proprietary data sets can make a material difference in relevance, including: Model management to add 3rd party transformer models and ML inference pipelines to create vector embeddings. Our new, pre-trained late interaction model’s superior relevance out of the box, across domains. Elasticsearch’s retrieval capabilities for query time context window.
