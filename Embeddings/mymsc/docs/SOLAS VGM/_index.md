In November 2014, the International Maritime Organization adopted an amendment for the ‘Safety of Life at Sea’ convention (SOLAS) regarding mandatory container weight verification.

MSC, as a carrier, adheres to such regulations hence since July 1st, 2016,‘shippers’ are required to provide the ‘Verified Gross Mass’ (VGM) details of each shipment to MSC and the terminal operator.
 
It remains the shipper’s responsibility to obtain and provide the VGM details in accordance with local government guidelines before the carrier’s cut off time.

## WEIGHT DEFINITION

VGM is determined by using the following methods:

Method 1: Weighing the packed container once all cargo has been loaded & sealed in to the container.

Method 2: by adding the weight of the cargo (including packaging), dunnage and the container tare weight.

MSC recommend that shippers keep a record of VGM’s for requests by authorities.

## EMPTY CONTAINER WEIGHT (CONTAINER TARE WEIGHT)

The container tare weight can be verified in two ways:

Method 1: The tare weight is printed outside the container doors.

Method 2: You can also check the same by logging into myMSC.com at the ‘Container Tare Weight Search’ section.
