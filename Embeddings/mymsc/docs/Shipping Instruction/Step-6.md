If there are many containers in your shipment, myMSC offers a functionality in the shipping instruction edit screen to export, edit and re-upload the cargo details without using the UI using a standardized excel template.

To Download the excel template click on the Export excel icon in the SI as shown below. This will download a macro-enabled excel file including all the details available in the cargo section at that moment.

The Excel template will be downloaded automatically (you will need to enable the spreadsheet to run macros in order to use it):

All mandatory cells are highlighted by a red triangle in the cells themselves

You can give the entire Cargo and container details in the Excel and upload it in myMSC by clicking on the upload button

After uploading the excel file, the system validates it and raises an error message in case of missing or not correct information. You will need to provide all the correct/mandatory details for the upload to run successfully

If no error message is raised, then the details provided in the template have passed the validation and it can be saved by clicking on the save button
