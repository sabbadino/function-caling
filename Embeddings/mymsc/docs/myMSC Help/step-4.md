Keeping your data secure is very important to us at MSC. That’s why we are introducing Multi-factor
Authentication (MFA) for your myMSC portal.

# WHAT IS MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA) ?

MSC is taking steps to make sure that only authorised users can log into myMSC.

Multi-factor Authentication – also known as two-factor verification – is an extra security verification. It consists of a
combination of your username, password, and a code received via your mobile device or phone

MFA is more secure than just a password because it relies on **two forms of authentication:**

+	Something you know, like your password.

+	Something you have, like a phone or other device that you carry.

MFA can help to stop hackers from pretending to be you. Even if they have your password, they are unlikely to have
your device, too.

## WHEN DO I NEED TO USE MFA?

After your first MFA login, you will be asked to verify your account using MFA every 45 days.

You will also be prompted to use MFA if you log in from a different IP address or if you cleared your browser
cache.

## WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?

When you log on myMSC, after selecting your location, you will be directed to the login page. Log in using your
myMSC credentials and click on SIGN IN.

***IMPORTANT NOTE: if the account is based on a shared mailbox, you must select Email as the preferred MFA method (see below how to set it up). This way, the security code will be sent to the general mailbox. If another colleague completes the MFA from another device or after 45 days, he/she will still be able to receive the code in the same shared mailbox. This email address cannot be amended.***

Should you need to modify the information provided for the MFA, please contact your preferred MSC Agency.***
